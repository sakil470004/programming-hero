                Difference in Array method, map() vs filter() vs find() vs forEach() ???
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>
                    Ans:
                    <br>
                    map => It can loop over an array. Return the output as an array. We can use it as a for loop with
                    extra functionality.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    forEach => We can loop though the an array with the forEach method.It do not return anything like
                    map.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    filter => We can loop though the an array with the filter method. It's same as map . But there is a
                    difference in work . It will only give the element which match it's condition.If there is a
                    condition it cann't match to anyone.It will give [] array.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    find => Find has same functionality as filter but it return only first element which match it's
                    condition.

                Local Storage vs Session Storage vs Cookies ???

                <p>
                    Local Storage => Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later,
                    such as offline data.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is especially useful for storing data that you want to persist even if the user closes the
                    browser, such as preferences or settings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Session Storage => Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web
                    applications.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cookies => Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for a long time,
                    such as session IDs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cookies are often used to store data that is not sensitive, such as user preferences

                What is event Loop in JS ? How it work ?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>
                    JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
                    collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from
                    models in other languages like C and Java.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.
