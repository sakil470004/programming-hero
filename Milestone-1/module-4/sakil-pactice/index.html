            <h1>What About Asta?</h1>
            <p>
                Asta is a young man with a short stature, but a strong, ripped build and a pair of green eyes. He also
                has messy ash blond hair and a single strand protruding upwards from the center of his head. He keeps
                his hair together with a black headband, which has the gold-colored Black Bull insignia and a
                red-colored four-sided star with three stitches on it.</p>
            <p>
                Asta's clothing consists of a white tunic with a V-shaped collar and long sleeves covered by a dark blue
                jacket whose sleeves extend only up to his elbows. He wears a pair of pants whose color is similar to
                his jacket, which has a stitch marks on the left knee. His pants also extends just below his knees. His
                shoes is made out of two different cloths, the parts covering his ankles, the soles the same color as
                his jacket and pants. The parts covering his toes are white, a vertical stitch mark going from the
                bridge to his toes.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p> After receiving his grimoire, Asta wears a pouch strapped to a brown leather belt. Additionally, as a
                Black Bull member, he wears his squad's signature robe, which is black and short with gold trimming and
                that covers the upper half of his torso. It also has a hood and a gold-colored button located at the
                right-hand side to hold it together, while the left-hand side displays the squad's insignia.

                <ol>
                    <li>Demon-Slayer </li>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Asta’s demon-slayer sword is that which came first from his five-leafed grimoire. This
                            antimagic sword technique pushes and condenses magic at the edges of its blade.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This sword can be enlarged by extending Anti Magic from the edges of the blade, while the
                            flat side of the sword can be used to deflect spells.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Asta can also remotely control the Anti Magic within the sword, allowing him to summon the
                            sword back to himself by holding his hand open, calling its name, and ridding it through the
                            air.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Asta’s second sword, i.e., the Demon-Dweller sword, can release projected slashes of Anti
                            Magic, allowing him to cut through spells from a distance.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It can also borrow the magic from the people around him, allowing him to release slashes
                            that possess the properties of other magic attributes.
                            <br />

                            Asta and Demon Dweller sword
                            Besides Licht, only Asta can wield this sword because he possesses no mana, as other mages
                            would not be able to use any magic while in contact with the sword and would have their mana
                            reserves depleted.

                            Demon-Destroyer Sword: Asta’s third and strongest sword possesses an ability known as
                            Causality Break.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Causality break is a technique that absorbs and cuts through the cause/effect relationship
                            in a spell. This technique allows the sword to generate Anti Magic tendrils that can absorb
                            and remove the aftereffects of spells.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Its strongest ability lies in the fact that it can even negate Reincarnation Magic and
                            poison.

                            This Sword contain Yami and asta's devil power. Which make it more special
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The Demon Slasher Katana is a very recent sword used by Asta. This sword is also very
                            special to him as it was given to him by Yami. At first it was just a normal Katana, but as
                            soon as Asta touched it in his Devil Unite mode, it underwent a complete transformation.
                            The best part of the Demon Slasher Katana is that it listens to the wielder’s will and will
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            only cut down the things Asta wants to. This is why Yami and William were completely
                            unharmed during the Infinity Slash Equinox spell used by Asta on Lucifero. It is a great
                            sword for close-ranged combat, and similar to Yami, Asta uses it with Anti-Magic in place of
                            Dark Magic.
